# midist - Distribution plot of MI from adjacency matrices.

This script takes an adjacency matrix of Mutual Information (MI) between genes in a pool
encoded as [SIF files](http://cytoscape.org/manual/Cytoscape2_5Manual.html#SIF%20Format )
and builds a lineplot showing the probability distribution of MI.
